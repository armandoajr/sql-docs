### Known issues

The following sections describe known issues with the Genera Availability (GA) release of SQL Server 2017 on Linux.

#### General

- Upgrades to the GA release of SQL Server 2017 are supported only from CTP 2.1 or higher. 

- The length of the hostname where SQL Server is installed needs to be 15 characters or less. 

    - **Resolution**: Change the name in /etc/hostname to something 15 characters long or less.

- Manually setting the system time backwards in time will cause SQL Server to stop updating the internal system time within SQL Server.

    - **Resolution**: Restart SQL Server.

- Only single instance installations are supported.

    - **Resolution**: If you want to have more than one instance on a given host, consider using VMs or Docker containers. 

- SQL Server Configuration Manager can’t connect to SQL Server on Linux.

- The default language of the **sa** login is English.

    - **Resolution**: Change the language of the **sa** login with the **ALTER LOGIN** statement.

#### Databases

- The master database cannot be moved with the mssql-conf utility. Other system databases can be moved with mssql-conf.

- When restoring a database that was backed up on SQL Server on Windows, you must use the **WITH MOVE** clause in the Transact-SQL statement.

- Distributed transactions requiring the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator service are not supported on SQL Server running on Linux. SQL Server to SQL Server distributed transactions are supported.

- Certain algorithms (cipher suites) for Transport Layer Security (TLS) do not work properly with SQL Server on Linux. This results in connection failures when attempting to connect to SQL Server, as well as problems establishing connections between replicas in high availability groups.

   - **Resolution**: Modify the **mssql.conf** configuration script for SQL Server on Linux to disable problematic cipher suites, by doing the following:

      1. Add the following to /var/opt/mssql/mssql.conf.

      ```
      [network]
      tlsciphers=ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:!ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:!ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:!ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:!ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:!DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:!DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:!DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:!DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA256:!DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:!DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA:!DHE-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!NULL-SHA256:!NULL-SHA
      ```

      1. Restart SQL Server with the following command.

      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart mssql-server
      ```

- SQL Server 2014 databases on Windows that use In-memory OLTP cannot be restored on SQL Server 2017 on Linux. To restore a SQL Server 2014 database that uses in-memory OLTP, first upgrade the databases to SQL Server 2016 or SQL Server 2017 on Windows before moving them to SQL Server on Linux via backup/restore or detach/attach.

- User permission **ADMINISTER BULK OPERATIONS** is not supported on Linux at this time.

#### Networking

Features that involve outbound TCP connections from the sqlservr process, such as linked servers or Availability Groups, might not work if both the following conditions are met:

1. The target server is specified as a hostname and not an IP address.

1. The source instance has IPv6 disabled in the kernel. To verify if your system has IPv6 enabled in the kernel, all the following tests must pass:

   - `cat /proc/cmdline` will print the boot cmdline of the current kernel. The output must not contain `ipv6.disable=1`.
   - The /proc/sys/net/ipv6/ directory must exist.
   - A C program that calls `socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP)` should succeed - the syscall must return an fd != -1 and not fail with EAFNOSUPPORT.

The exact error depends on the feature. For linked servers, this manifests as a login timeout error. For Availbility Groups, the `ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP JOIN` DDL on the secondary will fail after 5 minutes with a download configuration timeout error.

To work around this issue, do one of the following:

1. Use IPs instead of hostnames to specify the target of the TCP connection.

1. Enable IPv6 in the kernel by removing `ipv6.disable=1` from the boot cmdline. The way to do this depends on the Linux distribution and the bootloader, such as grub. If you do want IPv6 to be disabled, you can still disable it by setting `net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1` in the `sysctl` configuration (eg `/etc/sysctl.conf`). This will still prevent the system's network adapter from getting an IPv6 address, but allow the sqlservr features to work.

#### Network File System (NFS)
If you use **Network File System (NFS)** remote shares in production, note the following support requirements:

- Use NFS version **4.2 or higher**. Older versions of NFS do not support required features, such as fallocate and sparse file creation, common to modern file systems.
- Locate only the **/var/opt/mssql** directories on the NFS mount. Other files, such as the SQL Server system binaries, are not supported.
- Ensure that NFS clients use the 'nolock' option when mounting the remote share.

#### Localization

- If your locale is not English (en_us) during setup, you must use UTF-8 encoding in your bash session/terminal. If you use ASCII encoding, you might see an error similar to the following:

   ```
   UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf1' in position 8: ordinal not in range(128)
   ```

   If you cannot use UTF-8 encoding, run setup using the MSSQL_LCID environment variable to specify your language choice.

   ```bash
   sudo MSSQL_LCID=<LcidValue> /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```

- When running mssql-conf setup, and performing a non-English installation of SQL Server, incorrect extended characters are displayed after the localized text, "Configuring SQL Server...". Or, for non-Latin based installations, the sentence might be missing completely. The missing sentence should display the following localized string: "The licensing PID was successfully processed.  The new edition is [<Name> edition]”. This string is output for information purposes only, and the next SQL Server Cumulative Update will address this for all languages. This does not affect the successful installation of SQL Server in any way. 

#### Full-Text Search

- Not all filters are available with this release, including filters for Office documents. For a list of supported filters, see [Install SQL Server Full-Text Search on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-full-text-search.md#filters).

#### <a id="ssis"></a> SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

- The **mssql-server-is** package is not supported on SUSE in this release. It is currently supported on Ubuntu and on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

- With SSIS on Linux CTP 2.1 Refresh and later, SSIS packages can use ODBC connections on Linux. This functionality has been tested with the SQL Server and the MySQL ODBC drivers, but is also expected to work with any Unicode ODBC driver that observes the ODBC specification. At design time, you can provide either a DSN or a connection string to connect to the ODBC data; you can also use Windows authentication. For more info, see the [blog post announcing ODBC support on Linux](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssis/2017/06/16/odbc-is-supported-in-ssis-on-linux-ssis-helsinki-ctp2-1-refresh/).

- The following features are not supported in this release when you run SSIS packages on Linux:
  - SSIS Catalog database
  - Scheduled package execution by SQL Agent
  - Windows Authentication
  - Third-party components
  - Change Data Capture (CDC)
  - SSIS Scale Out
  - Azure Feature Pack for SSIS
  - Hadoop and HDFS support
  - Microsoft Connector for SAP BW

For a list of built-in SSIS components that are not currently supported, or that are supported with limitations, see [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md#components).

For more info about SSIS on Linux, see the following articles:
-   [Blog post announcing SSIS support for Linux](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssis/2017/05/17/ssis-helsinki-is-available-in-sql-server-vnext-ctp2-1/).
-   [Install SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-ssis.md)
-   [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md)

#### SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

The following limitations apply to SSMS on Windows connected to SQL Server on Linux.

- Maintenance plans are not supported.

- Management Data Warehouse (MDW) and the data collector in SSMS are not supported. 

- SSMS UI components that have Windows Authentication or Windows event log options do not work with Linux. You can still use these features with other options, such as SQL logins. 

- Number of log files to retain cannot be modified.

- Certain algorithms (cipher suites) for Transport Layer Security (TLS) do not work properly with SQL Server on Linux. This results in connection failures when attempting to connect to SQL Server, as well as problems establishing connections between replicas in high availability groups.

   - **Resolution**: Modify the **mssql.conf** configuration script for SQL Server on Linux to disable problematic cipher suites, by doing the following:

      1. Add the following to /var/opt/mssql/mssql.conf.

      ```
      [network]
      tlsciphers=ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:!ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:!ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:!ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:!ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:!ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:!DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:!DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:!DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:!DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:!DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA256:!DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA256:!DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:!DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA:!DHE-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!NULL-SHA256:!NULL-SHA
      ```

      1. Restart SQL Server with the following command.
   
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart mssql-server
      ```

- SQL Server 2014 databases on Windows that use In-memory OLTP cannot be restored on SQL Server 2017 on Linux. To restore a SQL Server 2014 database that uses in-memory OLTP, first upgrade the databases to SQL Server 2016 or SQL Server 2017 on Windows before moving them to SQL Server on Linux via backup/restore or detach/attach.

#### Remote database files

- Hosting database files on a NFS server is not supported in this release. This includes using NFS for shared disk failover clustering as well as databases on non-clustered instances. We are working on enabling NFS server support in the upcoming releases.

#### Localization

- If your locale is not English (en_us) during setup, you must use UTF-8 encoding in your bash session/terminal. If you use ASCII encoding, you might see an error similar to the following:

   ```
   UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf1' in position 8: ordinal not in range(128)
   ```

   If you cannot use UTF-8 encoding, run setup using the MSSQL_LCID environment variable to specify your language choice.

   ```bash
   sudo MSSQL_LCID=<LcidValue> /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```

#### Full-Text Search
- Not all filters are available with this release, including filters for Office documents. For a list of supported filters, see [Install SQL Server Full-Text Search on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-full-text-search.md#filters).

#### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
You can run SSIS packages on Linux. For more info, see the following articles:
-   [Blog post announcing SSIS support for Linux](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssis/2017/05/17/ssis-helsinki-is-available-in-sql-server-vnext-ctp2-1/).
-   [Install SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-ssis.md)
-   [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md)

Please note the following known issues with this release.

- The **mssql-server-is** package is supported on Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) in this release.

- With SSIS on Linux CTP 2.1 Refresh and later, SSIS packages can use ODBC connections on Linux. This functionality has been tested with the SQL Server and the MySQL ODBC drivers, but is also expected to work with any Unicode ODBC driver that observes the ODBC specification. At design time, you can provide either a DSN or a connection string to connect to the ODBC data; you can also use Windows authentication. For more info, see the [blog post announcing ODBC support on Linux](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssis/2017/06/16/odbc-is-supported-in-ssis-on-linux-ssis-helsinki-ctp2-1-refresh/).

- The following features are not supported in this release when you run SSIS packages on Linux:
  - SSIS Catalog database
  - Scheduled package execution by SQL Agent
  - Windows Authentication
  - Third-party components
  - Change Data Capture (CDC)
  - SSIS Scale Out
  - Azure Feature Pack for SSIS
  - Hadoop and HDFS support
  - Microsoft Connector for SAP BW

#### SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
The following limitations apply to SSMS on Windows connected to SQL Server on Linux.

- Maintenance plans are not supported.

- Management Data Warehouse (MDW) and the data collector in SSMS are not supported. 

- SSMS UI components that have Windows Authentication or Windows event log options do not work with Linux. You can still use these features with other options, such as SQL logins. 

- Number of log files to retain cannot be modified.

### Known issues
The following sections describe known issues with this release of SQL Server 2017 RC1 on Linux.

#### General
- The length of the hostname where SQL Server is installed needs to be 15 characters or less. 

    - **Resolution**: Change the name in /etc/hostname to something 15 characters long or less.

- Manually setting the system time backwards in time will cause SQL Server to stop updating the internal system time within SQL Server.

    - **Resolution**: Restart SQL Server.

- Only single instance installations are supported.

    - **Resolution**: If you want to have more than one instance on a given host, consider using VMs or Docker containers. 

- SQL Server Configuration Manager can’t connect to SQL Server on Linux.

- The default language of the **sa** login is English.

    - **Resolution**: Change the language of the **sa** login with the **ALTER LOGIN** statement.

#### Databases

- System databases cannot be moved with the mssql-conf utility.

- When restoring a database that was backed up on SQL Server on Windows, you must use the **WITH MOVE** clause in the Transact-SQL statement.

- Distributed transactions requiring the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator service are not supported on SQL Server running on Linux. SQL Server to SQL Server distributed transactions are supported.

#### Remote database files

- Hosting database files on a NFS server is not supported in this release. This includes using NFS for shared disk failover clustering as well as databases on non-clustered instances. We are working on enabling NFS server support in the upcoming releases.

#### Cross platform availability groups and distributed availability groups

- Due to a known issue, creating availability groups with replicas on instances hosted on both Windows and Linux is not working in this release. This includes distributed availability groups. The fix will be available in the upcoming release candidate build. 

#### Server Collation

- When using the MSSQL_COLLATION override, OR when doing a localized (non English) install, it is possible SQL Server will hit a deadlock when trying to set the server collation, which generates a dump. Setup does complete successfully, however the server collation will not have been set. The workaround is to simply run ./mssql-conf set-collation and enter the collation name desired when prompted (the collation name can be found in the errorlog at the line: “Attempting to change default collation to …”). 
 
#### Localization

- If your locale is not English (en_us) during setup, you must use UTF-8 encoding in your bash session/terminal. If you use ASCII encoding, you might see an error similar to the following:

   ```
   UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf1' in position 8: ordinal not in range(128)
   ```

   If you cannot use UTF-8 encoding, run setup using the MSSQL_LCID environment variable to specify your language choice.

   ```bash
   sudo MSSQL_LCID=<LcidValue> /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf setup
   ```

#### <a name = "fci"></a>Shared disk cluster instance upgrade

In RC1 the cluster resource agent sets the virtual server name like it does in a Failover Cluster Instance on Windows. Prior to RC1 `@@servername` on a shared disk cluster returned the specific node name so after failover `@@servername` returned a different value. In RC1 the serverName of the shared disk cluster instance is updated with the resource name when the resource is added to the cluster. Because of this, the cluster will have to restart the SQL Server after the manual failover during the upgrade - as in the following steps:

1. Upgrade secondary (passive) cluster node first.
   - Upgrade **mssql-server** package.
   - Upgrade **mssql-server-ha** package.
1. Manually fail over to the upgraded node.
   `pcs resource move <resourceName>`
   - Resource fails initially because the resource agent checks the actual and expected serverName. The expected serverName will be different.
   - Cluster will restart SQL Server resource on the same node. This will update the server name.
1. Upgrade the other node. 
   - Upgrade **mssql-server** package.
   - Upgrade **mssql-server-ha** package.
1. Remove the constraint added by the manual resource move. See [Failover cluster manually](sql-server-linux-shared-disk-cluster-red-hat-7-operate.md#failManual).
2. If desired, fail back to the original primary node. 

#### Availability group

On Linux, rolling upgrade of SQL Server 2017 CTP 2.1 to RC1 is not supported. After you upgrade the secondary replica, it will disconnect from the primary replica until the primary replica is upgraded. Microsoft is planning to resolve this for a future release.

#### Full-Text Search
- Not all filters are available with this release, including filters for Office documents. For a list of supported filters, see [Install SQL Server Full-Text Search on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-full-text-search.md#filters).

#### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

- The **mssql-server-is** package is not supported on SUSE in this release. It is currently supported on Ubuntu and on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

- The following features are not supported in this release when you run SSIS packages on Linux:
  - SSIS Catalog database
  - Scheduled package execution by SQL Agent
  - Windows Authentication
  - Third-party components
  - Change Data Capture (CDC)
  - SSIS Scale Out
  - Azure Feature Pack for SSIS
  - Hadoop and HDFS support
  - Microsoft Connector for SAP BW

-   [Install SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-ssis.md)
-   [Extract, transform, and load data on Linux with SSIS](sql-server-linux-migrate-ssis.md)

#### SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
The following limitations apply to SSMS on Windows connected to SQL Server on Linux.

- Maintenance plans are not supported.

- Management Data Warehouse (MDW) and the data collector in SSMS are not supported. 

- SSMS UI components that have Windows Authentication or Windows event log options do not work with Linux. You can still use these features with other options, such as SQL logins. 

- Number of log files to retain cannot be modified.
